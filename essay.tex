\section{Introduction}

This question will be answered by looking at different sources that discuss communication and issues with communication within the development cycle. We will also find whether communication issues are more common in agile development when compared to other forms of development cycles (such as waterfall) because of the frequency of meetings and the high level of attendance from each member of the team that this requires. We will also look at how we can fix and prevent situations in which specifically two members of a team strongly disagree on a design choice and how this can have a affect on the team working with them. I will also consider looking into personality traits and how keeping them in mind can help the work process.

\section{Obstacles}

Obstacles during a project can easily create conflict within a team if not dealt with precisely and correctly, in this section I will be writing about common obstacles in the development cycle and how they can be overcome in order to prevent conflict within a group. In the book "running an Agile software development project" chapter 1.7 The human factor by Mike Holcombe \cite{holcombe2008running} he talks about how different business models affect the workforce and their mentality towards projects differently. In this chapter he writes about the morale of a team being a vital component in a projects success and the factors that can lead to demoralization and lower quality work during the project. An example of this is when management focuses on smaller issues instead of the key ones during a project as nitpicking your team can be very frustrating for everyone involved, every team will have issues, no one team is perfect in every aspect.   

\section{Conflict within the team}

Conflict within the team is a situation that needs to be handled delicately and swiftly before it has chance to grow into a larger issue with the group working together. In the book "Integrating agile development in the real world" by Peter Schuh chapter 19 people \cite{schuh2004integrating} He talks about difficult conversations within a team and how the only real way to deal with bigger issues between members is to have a long conversation about the current issues and how to deal with them going onwards.
