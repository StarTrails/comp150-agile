\section{Introduction}

This question will be answered by looking at different sources that discuss communication and issues with communication within the development cycle. We will also find whether communication issues are more common in agile development when compared to other forms of development cycles (such as waterfall) because of the frequency of meetings and the high level of attendance from each member of the team that this requires. We will also look at how we can fix and prevent situations in which specifically two members of a team strongly disagree on a design choice and how this can have a affect on the team working with them. I will also consider looking into personality traits and how keeping them in mind can help the work process.

\section{Obstacles}

Obstacles during a project can easily create conflict within a team if not dealt with precisely and correctly, in this section I will be writing about common obstacles in the development cycle and how they can be overcome in order to prevent conflict within a group. In the book "running an Agile software development project" chapter 1.4 Obstacles by Mike Holcombe \cite{holcombe2008running} He talks about different business models and compares them to the agile methodology. In this section he also talks a lot about different software models and their effect on the team working with it in  their project.
